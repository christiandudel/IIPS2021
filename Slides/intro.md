# What is R?

- R is an open source statistical programming language
- First release in 1995
- Used for data analysis and statistical programming
  
# Why use R?

- Free, open source
- Can easily be extended
- More than 16,000 packages available
- Commonly used in both science and industry
- Tons of R-related materials: Books, journals, conferences, forums, tutorials...
- Many methods are already implemented in R

# Why use RStudio?

* RStudio comes on top of R
* RStudio is a tool to use R more efficiently
* Features:
    + Syntax highlighting, code folding
    + Project management (e.g., GitHub)
    + Markdown support
    + ...

# Disclaimer

- RStudio is not the only IDE/editor for R (ESS, RKWward, Tinn-R, ...)
- R can be used in many different ways
- Example: base R vs tidyverse vs data.table vs specialized packages
- I do things in certain ways, and my teaching follows that
- This does not mean that my solutions are the only or the best way to do things
